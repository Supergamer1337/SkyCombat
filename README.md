# SkyCombat

## Description
SkyCombat was created as a way to keep track of Initiative and Combat using the GENESYS ruleset. As such, it features an easy to use interface, and do most of the calculations, ordering and showcasing of dice on its own, giving the GM the ability to focus on storytelling.

## For Developers
To start developing, you should first fork and then clone the repo to a suitable place on your system.

If you don't already have yarn installed, check their [documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) for installation details.

Afterwards ``cd`` into the directory, and use
```sh
yarn install
```
to install all the dependencies. Afterwards, simply use
```sh
yarn dev
```
to start a development server.

Once you've made your changes, either build and deploy your own instance, or make a pull-request to this repo for me too look at it and merge it into the original code.
